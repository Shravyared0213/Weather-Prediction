Led a data mining project focused on weather prediction, this notebook aimed to analyze each attribute in the dataset and build machine learning models to increase model accuracy. The project involved data exploration to handle categorical and continuous variables. Outliers were identified using various plots like histogram, box plot, violin plot, and distribution plot. Algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier were employed for model training, showcasing proficiency in data exploration, preprocessing, and predictive modeling techniques.
